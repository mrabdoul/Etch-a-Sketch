# Grid Sketch Web App

This web app allows you to create a sketch pad with a grid of squares. You can interact with the grid by hovering over the squares, leaving a pixelated trail like a pen would. Additionally, you can reset the grid and specify the number of squares per side.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid:** Create a grid of squares with a specified number of squares per side.
- **Hover Effect:** Enjoy a pixelated trail effect as you hover over the squares.
- **Customizable Grid Size:** Reset the grid by entering the desired number of squares per side (up to a maximum of 100).

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Hover over the squares to interact with the sketch pad.
3. Click the "New Grid" button to reset the grid and specify a new size.

## How to Run
